'''
Given a base-10 integer,n , convert it to binary (base-2).
Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation.
When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

Sample Input 1
5

Sample Output 1
1

Sample Input 2
13

Sample Output 2
2
'''

num = int(input())
x = bin(num).split("b")[1]   # Splitting the binary code
y = x.split("0")    # Splitting all 1's from 0's
print(len(max(y)))    # Printing max number of 1's

'''
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and 
odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).
Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Sample Input:
2
Hacker
Rank

Sample Output:
Hce akr
Rn ak
'''

l = []
for k in range(int(input())):
    st = input()
    l.append(f"{st[::2]} {st[1::2]}") #splitting the string based on even and odd indices

for i in l:
    print(i)

Task
Given an array, a, of size n distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following 3 lines:

1. Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps. where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
2. First Element: firstElement where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
3. Last Element: lastElement where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

Example: a =[4,3,1,2]
original a: 4 3 1 2
round 1  a: 3 1 2 4 swaps this round: 3
round 2  a: 1 2 3 4 swaps this round: 2
round 3  a: 1 2 3 4 swaps this round: 0

Output:
Array is sorted in 5 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 4

Sample Input 0
3
1 2 3

Sample Output 0
Array is sorted in 0 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3

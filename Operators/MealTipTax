'''
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), 
and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. 
Round the result to the nearest integer.
'''

def solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent):
    tip = (tip_percent * meal_cost) / 100
    tax = (tax_percent * meal_cost) / 100
    total_cost = round(meal_cost + tip + tax)
    print(total_cost)

meal_cost = float(input().strip())
tip_percent = int(input().strip())
tax_percent = int(input().strip())
solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent)

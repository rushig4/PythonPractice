'''
Task
Write a Calculator class with a single method: int power(int,int). The power method takes two integers,
n and p, as parameters and returns the integer result of n power of p. If either  or  is negative, then the method must throw an exception with the message:
n and p should be non-negative.

Note: Do not use an access modifier (e.g.: public) in the declaration for your Calculator class.

Sample Input
4
3 5
2 4
-1 -2
-1 3

Sample Output

n and p should be non-negative
n and p should be non-negative

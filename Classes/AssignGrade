'''
You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. 
Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.

Complete the Student class by writing the following:

A Student class constructor, which has 4 parameters:
A string, firstName.
A string, lastName.
An integer, idNumber.
An integer array (or vector) of test scores,scores .
A char calculate() method that calculates a Student object's average and returns the grade character representative of their calculated average:
Grading scale:

Letter  Average
O        90<= a <= 100
E        80<= a < 90
A        70<= a < 80
P        55<= a < 70
D        40<= a < 55
T             a <  40


Sample Input:
Heraldo Memelli 8135627
2
100 80

Sample Output:
 Name: Memelli, Heraldo
 ID: 8135627
 Grade: O

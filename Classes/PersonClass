'''
Write a Person class with an instance variable,age , and a constructor that takes an integer,initialAge , as a parameter. 
The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative;
if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0..
In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
    - If age <13, print You are young..
    - If age>13 and age<18, print You are a teenager..
Otherwise, print You are old..
